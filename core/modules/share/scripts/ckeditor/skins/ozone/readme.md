#CKEditor Skin "Ozone"

Ozone is a greyscale skin with a clean, modern appearance that doesn't overpower your content. It
is designed to fit well into any site with any color scheme. It makes heavy use of CSS3 techniques
to produce subtle shadows and gradients while degrading gracefully for older browsers. HTML5 data
URI's are used to minimize HTTP requests.
